Open Payments
-------------
The open_payments.py file works with the medical open payments data, which can be found here:  
  
http://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Explore-the-Data/Dataset-Downloads.html  
  
Using this data, the open_payments.py script will compute the amount donated to each hospital and report any donors that contribute to over 70% of a hospital's entire amount of donations received.
